README.txt

Folders are numbered according to the maintext figure to which they correspond (supplemental figures correspond to maintext figures, and related files are contained therein). 

For instance, the folder /5_ckr_motif contains the code used to generate motif analysis in Figure 5.

Please note that due to the large number of files, not all files could be imported and only scripts are included. For all input files associated with a particular script or figure, please contact andrew.b.kleist@gmail.com, madanm@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk, or bvolkman@mcw.edu.
